Suppose you are given the list [1, 1], if you add the last
two numbers and append it to the list, the new list will be [1, 1, 2].
If you repeat this addition sequence on the new list three more times,
you obtain [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]. Starting with [1, 1], can you print the
resulting list if you carry out this addition sequence 50 times? Youâ€™ve
just printed the first 50 elements of the Fibonacci sequence.
