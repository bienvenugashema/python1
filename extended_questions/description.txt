Advanced basics in Python involve nested lists, more data types,

and some more complex problems to solve. Here are a set of ad-
vanced problems to test your knowledge of what we covered earlier

today, and to test your understanding of this afternoon’s extra con-
tent!

If you’re new to programming and find these challenging, don’t
worry. Some of these problems are complicated, and if you’ve made
it this far you’re doing very well indeed! Ask a tutor for help, and for
praise on your progress.
